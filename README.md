**OpenShrooly** is a very early experimental replacement firmware for the Shrooly mushroom growing device.  
The intent is to convert the Shrooly into a **Wi-Fi–only device**, controllable from a local web interface or integrated with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

The 0.1 release should have enough to cultivate mushrooms (unfortunately my own shrooly is kind of broken so I haven't been able to test this yet)

⚠️ **Warning:** Use at your own risk! This project is experimental and may brick your device.
